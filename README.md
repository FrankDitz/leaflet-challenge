# leaflet-challenge
This challenge was pretty straight forward. The hardest part was figuring out how to properly scrape the data needed for this assignment but once I figured that out there wasn't too much trouble.
I used a couple websites to help me with some of the knowledge to figure out how to webscrape since this was my first official time outside of class doing so.
